# ui.py
#
# purpose: manages user interface elements, specifically the macos menu bar
#          icon updates and the functionality to paste text into the active application.
#
# dependencies: appkit (pyobjc wrapper for cocoa ui elements like nspasteboard)
#               quartz (pyobjc wrapper for coregraphics event simulation like key presses)
#               time (for small delays in paste simulation)
#               logging (for status messages)
#
# key components: menuicon class (static methods to update app title/icon)
#                 paste_text function (copies text to clipboard, simulates cmd+v)
#
# design rationale: uses appkit (via rumps integration indirectly for icon, directly
#                   for pasteboard) and quartz for native macos integration. icon
#                   updates provide visual feedback on the app's state. paste_text
#                   directly manipulates the general pasteboard and then simulates
#                   command-v keystrokes using coregraphics events for seamless pasting.
#                   the timer in menuicon.success provides a brief visual confirmation
#                   before resetting the icon.
