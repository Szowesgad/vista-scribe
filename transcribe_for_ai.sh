# transcribe_for_ai.sh - Wrapper script to run ai_transcriber.py with proper uv environment
# 
# This script helps AI assistants transcribe user voice messages by using
# vista-scribe's infrastructure. It looks for voice message files in standard
# locations and transcribes them using the local MLX Whisper model.
#
# Usage:
#   ./transcribe_for_ai.sh               # Find and transcribe latest voice message
#   ./transcribe_for_ai.sh --path FILE   # Transcribe a specific audio file
#   ./transcribe_for_ai.sh --no-format   # Transcribe without LLM formatting
